NOTES:

Add login handling.

startNewGame is currently only capable of handling chess games.

Test the "return" line in the beginning of handleCommandFromUser.

We may want to have an assocation from Game to PieceType to store all the PieceTypes somewhere..

Colour Class? Probably not.

Need to consider restart game. Idea: board.clearBoard() then board.init().

Currently the player who sets up the game is white.
